# CFML Tag to Script Conversions
#####A collection of examples demonstrating the conversion of CFML code blocks written in tags to CFScript.

> This is not a CFScript syntax documentation you're (possibly) looking for. That awesome piece of work, by Adam Cameron, can be found [here](https://github.com/adamcameron/cfscript) and is highly recommended as a reference to the content you'll find here.

The examples in this document are an attempt to demonstrate conversions of CFML tag-based code to script-based code as a way of learning / migrating to CFScript. It is assumed that you already have a relatively firm understanding of the ColdFusion Markup Language (at least on a tag-based level). For the sake of modernity, the converted examples will be written to comply with the most current versions of the various CFML engines at the time of writing - (ColdFusion 11, Railo 4.2 & Lucee 4.5).
